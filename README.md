# Enhancing Customer Satisfaction in the Airline Industry

_Created by Fitria Dwi Wulandari â€“ August, 2020_

### **Project Background**
In the highly competitive airline industry, customer satisfaction is crucial for maintaining passenger loyalty, enhancing the airline's reputation, and ensuring long-term business success. However, airlines often face challenges in understanding and addressing what causes passenger dissatisfaction. Common concerns among passengers include service quality, comfort, punctuality, and overall travel experience.

### **Methodology**
#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Data Preparation</code>
* **Source**: Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction), which contains airline passenger satisfaction survey.
* **Actions**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</code>
* **Purpose**: To discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.
* **Techniques**: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Machine Learning</code>
* **Goal**: Build models to predict customer satisfaction.
* **Approach**: Eight algorithms were evaluated to determine the best prediction model.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Tools</code>
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### **Results**
The analysis revealed that the Decision Tree model, achieving an accuracy of 93%, was the most effective in predicting customer satisfaction. This model's high accuracy underscores its potential as a valuable tool for airlines to anticipate and mitigate passenger dissatisfaction. By implementing the findings from this project, airlines can make data-driven decisions to refine their services, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction, increased loyalty, and a stronger competitive position in the market.

### **Future Work**
* **Model Improvement**: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
* **Broader Application**: Extend the analysis to other aspects of airline operations, such as flight delays and baggage handling, to further enhance customer experience.
