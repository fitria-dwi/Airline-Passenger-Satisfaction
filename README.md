### **Project Background**
   ---<br><br>
In the highly competitive airline industry, customer satisfaction is crucial for maintaining passenger loyalty, enhancing the airline's reputation, and ensuring long-term business success. However, airlines often face challenges in understanding and addressing what causes passenger dissatisfaction. Common concerns among passengers include service quality, comfort, punctuality, and overall travel experience.

## <ins>**Methodology**</ins>
  #### **Data Preparation**
  * Source: Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction), which contains airline passenger satisfaction survey.
  * Actions: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

  #### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * Purpose: To discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.
  * Techniques: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.

  #### **Machine Learning**
  * Goal: Build models to predict customer satisfaction.
  * Approach: Eight algorithms were evaluated to determine the best prediction model.

  #### **Machine Learning**
  * Programming Language: Python
  * Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### <ins>**Results**</ins>
The analysis revealed that the Decision Tree model, achieving an accuracy of 93%, was the most effective in predicting customer satisfaction. This model's high accuracy underscores its potential as a valuable tool for airlines to anticipate and mitigate passenger dissatisfaction. By implementing the findings from this project, airlines can make data-driven decisions to refine their services, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction, increased loyalty, and a stronger competitive position in the market.

### <ins>**Future Work**</ins>
* Model Improvement: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
* Broader Application: Extend the analysis to other aspects of airline operations, such as flight delays and baggage handling, to further enhance customer experience.
